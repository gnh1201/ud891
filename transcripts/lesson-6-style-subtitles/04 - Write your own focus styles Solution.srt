00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,340
Looking at the main.css file,
you'll notice the anchor tags and

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,080
the button tags have their
outline set to none.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,070
So I need to find all of the anchor and
button elements in this page and

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,360
give them new focus styles.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,950
This means I need to style
these navigation elements,

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,129
any buttons inside the Jumbotron,
and these raised elements.

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,780
Because I want my focus
tiles to look consistent,

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,710
I'm going to copy each of these
selectors and group them at the bottom.

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,810
Next, I'll add pseudo classes for
focus and hover to each.

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,280
Finally I'll add some styling.

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,570
I'm going to give each element
a red background on white texts.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,320
This reversing effect will really
make the focus buttons stand out.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,950
But I also want to be careful about
just conveying information with color.

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,772
Because some of my users may
have a color vision impairment.

15
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:55,990
Rob will talk about color vision
impairments in an upcoming lesson but

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,780
to cater to these users,
I'll also add a text underline.

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,570
So there's a bit more visual
indication that something has changed.

18
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,850
Finally I'll steal this fancy drop
shadow from the raised buttons and

19
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,400
apply it to all the elements.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,390
Adding some shadow will also help the
elements stand out a little bit more.

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,180
Tabbing through the updated site, I can
now clearly track focus across the page.

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,870
My designer's happy, because the focus
tiles fit the look of the site and

23
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,070
my keyboard users are happy, because
they can easily navigate the page.
