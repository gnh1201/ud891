Here's a disclosure button which
adds classes to the element for

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,140
styling the open and close states, but

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,132
I'm wondering if we could instead
style off of the area attributes.

4
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:13,770
This would create a nice
relationship between

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,780
the actual state of the component and
our visual representation.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,720
Take a look and see if you can find
a place where we could update our CSS

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,130
selectors to use ARIA
attributes instead of classes.
