00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,810
The area practices document has this
to say about the radio group pattern.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,930
Use a container with a roll radio
group for the set of radio buttons.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,370
So we set that attribute here.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,020
Then individual radio
buttons have a role of radio.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,222
So we set that here for
each radio button.

00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:23,263

00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:27,683
Now if a radio button's selected, it's
aria-checked attribute needs to be true

8
00:00:27,683 --> 00:00:30,155
and if it's not selected
it needs to be false.

10
00:00:41,802 --> 00:00:44,850
We come here to this
changeFocus function.

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,880
We need to make sure that we
keep the aria-checked attribute

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,390
in sync with the checked value.

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,090
So we need to modify our JavaScript.

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,712
So that every time we change
the checked attribute,

15
00:00:55,712 --> 00:00:58,045
we also change
the aria-checked attribute.

00:00:58,045 --> 00:00:58,545
