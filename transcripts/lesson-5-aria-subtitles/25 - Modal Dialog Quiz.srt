1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,605
Let's have a look at the HTML first.

2
00:00:02,605 --> 00:00:06,290
I see a FIXME here,
there's a role for that.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,010
Let's go have a look at
the aria roles we can use.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,155
All right, dialog seems like a good fit.

5
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:16,865
A dialog is an application window that
is designed to interrupt the current

6
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:20,995
processing of an application in order to
prompt the user to enter information or

7
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:23,055
require a response.

8
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:26,675
Let's add that role and
see how it changes things.

9
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:30,550
Now with ChromeVox Lite running, when I
click the Sign in button, it tells me,

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,970
Entered dialog,

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,360
Log in to Kangaroo Kilometers Dialog,
Frequent flyer number, Edit text.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,230
How did it know the name of the dialog?

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,800
Yeah, it already had
an aria-labelledby attribute on there,

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,990
pointing at the heading.

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,930
But at this point,
if I were to Shift+Tab backwards,

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,610
I would see that I could still jump
out of the dialog and into the footer.

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,596
If we look at the DOM, we can see why.

18
00:00:56,596 --> 00:01:00,020
The dialog is placed
after the page content.

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,820
So if we work backwards from the dialog,

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,690
we'll end up at the end
of the page contents.

21
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,770
Let's have a look at
the JavaScript here then.

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,818
There's a comment down here saying hide
non-modal content from screen readers.

23
00:01:10,818 --> 00:01:14,020
Perhaps aria-hidden would
be a good fit here.

24
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,070
So let's give that a shot.

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,650
We'll add a line here, looking for
that wrapper element, and

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,950
set the aria-hidden attribute to true.

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,840
Then of course,

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,830
we need to remember to set it back
to false once the dialog is closed.

29
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,125
Since the default value for

30
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:32,390
aria-hidden is false,
we can just remove the attribute.

31
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,752
Now let's see if that worked.

32
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:38,780
With ChromeVox Lite running,
I can open the dialog again.

33
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,630
And working backwards from this text
field, I go to the Log in button,

34
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,590
which is exactly what I would expect.

35
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,620
The focus is locked to just this dialog.

36
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,010
Awesome.

37
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,220
And if I close the dialog, the focus
goes back to the Sign in button,

38
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,450
exactly where we started this process.
