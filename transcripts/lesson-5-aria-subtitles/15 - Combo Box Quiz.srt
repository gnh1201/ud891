1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,610
This combo box example gets
most of the way there, but

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,230
it's missing some aria relationships.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,900
Let's take a look at
the current situation.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,205
>> Combo box example having
to [SOUND] choose a drink.

5
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:14,500
Combo box collapsed.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,310
>> I'll turn on ChromeVox Lite and
then tab to the combo box.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,220
It gets announced as Choose a drink:,
Combo box.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,900
So far, so good.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,430
Since this is a combo box,
I get this list of options.

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,240
I can choose with the arrow keys or
I can type.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,825
>> Expanded.

12
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:35,141
[SOUND] Choose a drink,
combo box expanded.

13
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:37,022
>> If I were to arrow
down into the list,

14
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:40,920
I can see that the selected item was
changing but I don't hear any feedback.

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,350
Now let's see a version with a few
tweaks to make it work well.

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,275
>> Combo box example.

17
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:50,132
[SOUND] Choose a drink, combo box.

18
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:52,786
>> Just as before,
I'll turn on ChromeVox Lite and

19
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,920
I move to the combo box.

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,420
Now, if I use the arrow keys
to move through the list,

21
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,990
>> Coffee one of seven.

22
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,656
>> It tells me coffee, one of seven
>> Tea two of seven.

23
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:06,250
>> Tea two of seven and so on.

24
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,490
>> Two of seven
>> Coffee one of two, O cola one of two,

25
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,660
coffee one of two.

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,550
>> And if I type in co and

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,070
arrow through the list again, it tells
me that there are now only two options.

28
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,940
So how do we fix this?

29
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,440
Well, the code sample
has a few FIXME's in it.

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,930
That's probably a good place to start.

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,270
Once you've done the combo box exercise,
come back here and answer this question.
