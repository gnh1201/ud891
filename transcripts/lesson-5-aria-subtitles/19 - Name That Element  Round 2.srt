1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,250
This first div has content
saying semantics, but

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,800
it also has an aria-hidden attribute.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,510
However, the aria-hidden attribute
doesn't have an explicit value.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,490
So, this element isn't actually
hidden from assistive technology.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,950
So it has a label, Semantics.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,650
This span has a role of checkbox and

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,770
is area labeled by an element with
an ID of label which is right below it.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,002
The element it's labeled by is hidden.

9
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:32,630
However, area-labeledby may refer
to elements which are hidden.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,040
So this gets a label of Styling.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,500
This button has a hidden attribute which
causes it to be explicitly not rendered,

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,490
so it has no label.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,440
And this span has a roll of button and

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,750
contains another span with the role
of image and an area label of menu.

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,650
Since the outer span
contains the inner span,

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,400
It uses its computed
label as its contents.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,460
So it ends up with a label of menu.
