1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,170
For this button, we have two options.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,530
The content, which says, Eucalyptus.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,600
Or the area that's labeled,
which says, Gumnut.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,410
We just learned that the aria-label
overrides any other native labeling,

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,000
including content.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,750
So in this case,
the button will have a label of Gumnut.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,380
For this native checkbox we have
a label field next to it, however,

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,720
the label is not correctly
associated with the input.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,410
So the input won't have a label.

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,470
We could fix that by giving the checkbox
an ID of roo, as well as a name.

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,070
For this div we have a role of
button and content, Wombat.

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,309
Normally a div on it's own wouldn't get
included in the accessibility tree.

13
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,070
We would just get the text
node inside of it.

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,581
But since it has a role of button,

15
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:52,544
it will be exposed as a button
with a label, Wombat.

16
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:56,460
And finally,
this span needs a pretty close look.

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,770
It has a role of checkbox.

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,890
aria-checked state is false.

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,110
aria-labeledby pointing to label.

20
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,470
And aria-label of, Not checked.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,210
So it will be exposed in accessibility
tree because it has a role.

22
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,940
But the label will be one of,
Not checked, and, Wallaby.

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,930
We heard in the previous lesson
that aria-labelledby overrides

24
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,870
all other types of labels.

25
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,770
So the label for this will be, Wallaby.
