00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,880
Okay, we just had a look at making
a screen reader accessible custom

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,250
checkbox.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,050
The more astute of you may have noticed
that while we did specify the checkbox

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,750
estate as checked,

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,260
that wasn't going to stay in sync with
the actual state of the checkbox.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,740
In this exercise your job is to
fully implement the area for

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,810
this custom checkbox.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,510
You'll need to give it
a roll of checkbox and

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,000
an area desc to checked value which
matches it's checked state at all times.
