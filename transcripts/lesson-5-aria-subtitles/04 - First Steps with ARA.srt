00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,530
In the JavaScript file,
in the Checkbox's initialization,

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,250
I'm going to add an initial
role of checkbox.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,210
I'm also going to add
an aria-checked value

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,780
dependent upon what the initial
checked value of the checkbox is.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,680
This function also looks promising.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,030
It changes the checked
attribute on the element.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,320
So I can just add an extra line here to
set the aria-checked value accordingly.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,550
Now when I interact with the checkbox,

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,330
you'll be able to see the aria-checked
attribute change in the DOM.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,150
You would also be able
to fire up VoiceOver and

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,567
see that it works just the same
as a regular checkbox too.
