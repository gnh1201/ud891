1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,469
We've seen that we can apply area
roles and properties to an element

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,090
to modify the way it is exposed
in the accessibility tree.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,170
The area practices doc helps us decide
what area roles and properties to use.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,920
We're going to start with the radio
group example from lesson two.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,080
You might remember we use the area
design patterns doc to get some guidance

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,309
as to what keyboard
handling we needed to add.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,420
In this exercise we're going to
revisit the same example.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,490
But we're going to follow the design
pattern guidance for the area role and

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,740
state on each radio button in the group.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,220
Remember to make sure
the state is kept in sync

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,750
with the visual state of the button.

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,878
One quick note, the area design
pattern mentions area-labeled by and

13
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,850
area-described by, we're going to
skip those for this exercise.

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,510
But you'll be learning
more about them shortly.
