1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,360
We've learned about ARIA roles,
Design Patterns, live regions, labeling

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,380
mechanisms, and ways to hide parts of
the page from assistive technology.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,840
Now we're going to put all of that
together by building on the modal dialog

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,900
from Lesson 2 to create
a fully semantic dialog

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,270
with a confirmation message
which appears on submit.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,630
Remember that modal dialog that
Rob showed us in Lesson two?

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,750
We're going to look at it in
the context of a more complicated page.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,880
So here, we have the familiar
flight booking page, and

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,590
we've added a sign up button here.

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,930
I'll start Chrome box light and

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,190
then tab through these links
to get to the sign up button.

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,620
>> Frequent flyer number.

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,990
Add a text.

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,010
>> I can press Enter or

15
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,140
Space to click the button which
pops open the modal dialog.

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,630
It focuses the first focusable element,
and tells me about that element.

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,420
Frequent flier number, edit text.

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,510
It doesn't give me any information
about the context for that form field.

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,636
In this case, we can get by without it.

20
00:00:56,636 --> 00:01:00,710
But it would have been nice to hear this
heading, and to know that we were in

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,879
a modal dialog and couldn't get to
the rest of the page without closing it.

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,518
I can use the Chrome Vox like
controls to work backwards to explore

23
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:12,705
the context for this form and see if
there's anything important in there.

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,970
>> Log into kangaroo
kilometers heading one

25
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,450
>> So going backwards,

26
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,220
I hear the heading log into
Kangaroo Kilometers, great.

27
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,250
Was there anything else I missed?

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,040
I'll hit previous again.

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,150
>> Copyright 2015 Udacity,
Internal link footer.

30
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,990
>> Okay.

31
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,360
Now I'm outside the dialogue
in the footer, what the?

32
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,345
Since Chrome Vox isn't directly
moving focus in this case,

33
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:41,640
our nice focus trapping code
didn't get triggered and

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,570
we were able to break
out of the dialogue.

35
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,120
So we have a couple of
issues we need to fix here.

36
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,990
We aren't told we're in a dialogue and

37
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,330
we can break out of the dialogue
with the screen reader.

38
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,350
Have a think back over this lesson, and
have a look at the hints in the code and

39
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,920
see if you can figure out
how we can fix these issues.

40
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,390
Once you fix the example,
come back here and

41
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,130
pick all the statements which are true.
