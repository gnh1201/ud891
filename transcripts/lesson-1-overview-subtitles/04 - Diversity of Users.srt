We just heard about a whole
range of impairment from Victor.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,123
He explained how we can consider
four broad types of impairments.

3
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:10,386
Visual impairment, motor impairment,

4
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:14,180
hearing impairment,
cognitive impairment.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,830
And he gave us some
examples of each of those.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,520
One other thing he mentioned,
was that for each type of impairment,

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,480
it could be temporary,
permanent or situational.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,225
So it really is the case that any
of us could experience one of these

9
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:35,416
impairments at any time, even if
only situationally or temporarily.

10
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:38,969
We're going to do some quizzes now,
for each impairment,

11
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,520
which of these categories
does that fall into?

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,410
Select all of the answers
you think apply.
