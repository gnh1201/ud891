Victor just showed us how he uses
a screen reader to access content.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,070
Now, it's your turn to try
out using a screen reader.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,800
This is chrome Vox lite.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,000
A minimal but functioning screen reader,
written in JavaScript,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,090
that we've injected into this page.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,500
>> Click a button.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,770
Heading one.

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,600
>> You can use the control panel at
the bottom of the screen to control

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
the screen reader.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,620
>> This screen reader has very
minimal functionality, but

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,600
we can explore the page using
the previous and next buttons.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,720
And click things,
using the click button.Give this a try.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,380
Using Chrome Vox lite, navigate to the I
love accessibility button and click it.

14
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,960
A word is going to appear on the screen,
come back here and

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,290
enter it into the text box.
