1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,790
Up at the top, we clearly have
the top level heading, The Funion.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:05,980
That's an h1.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,109
Next, we have In the News.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,810
This is quite small, but

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,320
actually if you look at it in dev tools,
you'll see that it's an h2.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,560
It's important that you don't fall into
the trap of using these heading tags

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,000
just to achieve a particular
look on the page.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,550
Sometimes we see people using heading
tags where they want some large text for

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,110
something like a pull quote, and it can
create quite a confusing experience.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,060
Or in a case like this, they might
think that because it's smaller

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,490
that it should be a lower heading level.

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,020
But actually,
since it's operating as a section title,

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,770
it should definitely be a level
two heading on this page.

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,558
Next we have the headline about cats.

15
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,170
That's an h3 on this page, because
it's inside the In the News section.
