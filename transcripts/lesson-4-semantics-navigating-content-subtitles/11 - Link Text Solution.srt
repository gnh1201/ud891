1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,760
Okay, let's have a look at these links.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,080
This link click here is
obviously a problem.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,920
Click here doesn't tell me anything
about what's going to happen

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,030
if I were to click it.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,930
So that's the first one,

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,480
all of these add to order
links look a bit suspicious.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,810
Add to order is an action but they're
at least styled to look like links.

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,360
If I were to pull up the dev tools,

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,620
I'll see that they're actually
implemented as buttons.

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,530
So those are fine.

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,270
Now this logo is also a link, but

12
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,120
once again if you open dev tools
you'll see that it has alt text.

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,080
So that's okay.

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,020
Now, if you were to tab through
the links you would see a problem.

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,980
It's skips over the navigation
links up at the top.

16
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,500
What's going on,
they're spans styled to look like links.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,830
Clearly this is an over
engineered restaurant website

18
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,650
built like a single page web app.

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,080
So I'm going to check that one as well.
