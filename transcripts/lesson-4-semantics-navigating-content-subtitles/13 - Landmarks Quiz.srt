00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,420
This blog uses some nice
readable CSS class names

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,140
which refer to page structure rather
than the details of the style used.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,290
For example, right up to
the top we see blog header and

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,740
a little further down this
banner area is called blog hero.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,090
For blog header, we could just as
easily have used a header element and

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,370
modify our style sheet to refer to
the tag name instead of the class.

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,590
And then we would get the added benefit
of some extra semantic information for

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,780
assistive technology users.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,495
We've highlighted four
other areas of this page

10
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:40,245
which have some class names suggestive
of the HTML sectioning elements

11
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:42,205
of the page we just learned about.

12
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:46,535
Your job is to fill in the appropriate
tag names just like we did with header.
