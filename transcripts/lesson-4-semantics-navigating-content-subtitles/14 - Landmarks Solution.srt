00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,090
All right, first up,
this little list of links in the header.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,610
If I inspect one of those links,

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,290
I could see it's in a div
with the class of blog nav.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,150
So that could just as
easily be a nav element.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,920
Next, this big green section,
it's under the hero section.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,550
And I see something called row.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,816
But I think that's just
a layout helper div so

8
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:23,310
I'm going to drill a little deeper.

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,280
The next element we see
has a class of col-sm-8

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,880
which seems like a grid system class,
but also blog-main.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,172
So that's probably a good candidate for
our main element.

12
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:37,900
This sidebar here,
this one's a little tricky.

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,110
But if we look through our
list of semantic elements,

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,261
we see there is one called aside.

15
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:45,420
The spec says of aside
that it can be used for

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,420
groups of nav elements and
for other content

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,930
that is considered separate from
the main content of the page.

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,710
So we could definitely
use an aside here.

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,260
Finally, right inside the main element
we have something called blog-post.

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,370
Now there's no post element, but

21
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,660
there is certainly an article element
and that would work really well here.
