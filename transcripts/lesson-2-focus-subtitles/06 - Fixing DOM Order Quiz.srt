1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,680
Here's a page with a busted tab order.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,080
Go ahead try to navigate this
page using the keyboard only

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,830
you'll find you skip around a lot.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,690
It would be much easier if
we navigated in this order.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,750
Navigation links, search,
content links and then the footer.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,950
Using a text editor, see if you can fix
the order of the elements in the DOM, so

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,390
that the tab order makes sense.
