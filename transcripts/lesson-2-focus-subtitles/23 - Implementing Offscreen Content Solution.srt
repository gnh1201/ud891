00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,680
Tapping through the page,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,780
it seems like focus jumps out of order
some where after these navigation links.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,770
If I use document.activeElement, or if
I were to use the accessibility audit,

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,710
I can see that the item stealing
is a button with a class of close.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,960
Looking at my source code, it appears
that there's some markup for a modal.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,020
And sure enough, there's a button
with a class of close here.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,300
Since I'm not currently
displaying this modal,

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,230
I'll update my CSS to set anything
with the class modal to display none.

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,560
That will opt it and all of its
children out of the tab order.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,650
When I want to display the modal,
I can just override that style.
