1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,960
In this quiz, you're going to need
to add keyboard event listeners

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,510
to this collection of elements
with the class radiogroup.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,570
Note that the individual radio
buttons have a class of radio.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,906
The radio buttons are stored in
this.buttons within radiogroup.js.

5
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:19,066
There's also a focused index variable,

6
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:22,760
which is the index of the element
that should be focused.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,200
There are already keyboard listeners for
both the up and left and down and

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,300
right arrow keys.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,550
However, it's up to us to figure
out which index should be focused

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,060
when those arrow keys are pressed.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,980
Keep in mind that there are only three
children, so if the index gets too high

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,590
or too low, we'll need to loop back
around in the other direction.

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,060
Once we've set the correct focus index,

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,810
the changeFocus method down here
should take care of the rest.
