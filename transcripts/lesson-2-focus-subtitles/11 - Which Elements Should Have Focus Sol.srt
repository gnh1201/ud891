1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,105
The following elements
should have focus.

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:04,077
Header links,

3
00:00:04,077 --> 00:00:06,683
[BLANK_AUDIO]

4
00:00:06,683 --> 00:00:11,553
Search fields, form input fields,
and the Submit button,

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:15,770
our large Call to Action button,
and footer links.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,560
I'm not going to add tabindex
to any of these headings.

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,730
I'm not going to add tabindex
to any of these headings or

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,410
the paragraphs of text.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,470
Even if that content seems super
important, it's not something the user

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,080
can interact with, so
there's no reason to make it focusable.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,620
Similarly, even if this big
image is really awesome,

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,870
there is no reason to make it focusable.

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,730
Screen reader users will still be able
to understand the content of the image,

14
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,770
so long as we provide
proper Alt tag support,

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,890
which Alice will touch on
in just a few lessons.
