1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,370
Here's how I did it.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,520
Looking at the markup for the page,
I can see that the search link

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,550
is actually higher in the DOM
order than the other links.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,120
And it's using this pull-right class
here to float over to one side.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,430
The easiest thing to do here is
to just move the search button

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,140
below the other elements.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,460
That will give the same
visual presentation but

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,820
now the tab order makes sense.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,570
I also noticed that
the newsletter is jumping

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,060
ahead of the other elements
on the page because it's

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,390
absolutely positioned to appear
at the bottom of the page.

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,850
Just like the search link,
I'll move the newsletter

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,400
down to the bottom of the document
just after the main element.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,750
Now is also a good time to improve
our semantics a little bit.

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,000
Instead of just using a div for

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,180
this element,
I can replace it with a footer tag.

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,590
Doing so can benefit screen readers
who rely on these kind of landmarked

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,100
elements to navigate the page.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,280
And it's also a little more concise
than saying div class equals footer.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,320
I'll also talk more about semantics and
navigation in a future lesson.
