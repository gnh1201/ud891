00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,750
Here's a little sample app,

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:06,270
where the focus indicator seems
to get lost as we tab around.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,530
I suspect it's focusing
something offscreen, but

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,950
I'm not sure exactly which
element is the culprit.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,470
Using some of the information
from the previous lesson.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,740
Can you track down
the element in question and

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,640
update the code with
an appropriate fix?.
