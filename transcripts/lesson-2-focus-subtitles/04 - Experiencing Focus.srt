1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,960
Starting with my first few tab presses,
the browser highlights the navigation

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,160
items for flights,
hotels and rental cars.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,560
If I keep pressing tab it
takes me to the radio group

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,180
where I can choose between round trip,
one way and multi city.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,390
Here, I can use the arrow keys
to select a round trip ticket.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,580
We can keep tabbing and
filling in our personal information.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,480
When we arrive at the destination,
we can use our arrow keys or

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,460
start typing to auto complete the field.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,750
Similarly, in the date field we can use
our arrow keys or just type out a date.

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,220
Selecting window seat also relies
either on the arrow keys or

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,680
typing W to jump to
the window seat option.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,610
And we can disable promotional offers
check box by pressing the spacebar.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,120
The last thing to do is focus
the search button and press Enter.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,060
There's something quite nice to
being able to fill out a form

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,530
using just your keyboard and
not having to switch over to the mouse.

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,270
Because all of the elements
used in the form are native

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,380
HTML tags with implicit focus the form
itself just works with the keyboard.

18
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,180
And we don't need to write any
code to add focus behavior.
