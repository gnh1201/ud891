1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,349
Inside each section of the page, I'm
going to find an appropriate header like

2
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:08,602
these h2s, and
give it a tab index of negative 1.

3
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:12,010
Next, I'll open the router
code in main.js.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,626
When the page changes,
I'll look for a new header

5
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:19,390
by calling newPage.querySelector h2 and
its focus method.

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,430
To prevent this code from running
the first time the user visits the site,

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll add a little guard
variable called isFirstPage and

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,730
set that to false after
the first page runs.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,490
>From then on, anytime we switch to a new
page, our header focus code will run.
