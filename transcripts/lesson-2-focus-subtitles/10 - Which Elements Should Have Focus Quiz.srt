Rob just told us that we
should typically only add tab

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,590
index attributes to interactive
elements and not our site content.

00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,930
With that in mind, given
the following page, check the box for

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,870
any element which should be focusable.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,510
This could be an element
that is natively focused or

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,570
one that you might add a tab index to.
