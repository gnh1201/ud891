1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,998
In this example,

2
00:00:00,998 --> 00:00:04,588
we have a single element on the page
that looks like a button, but

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:08,792
if we take a look at the HTML source,
we can see it's not actually a button.

4
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:12,695
And if we try to use it with the screen
reader, we'd run into problems.

5
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:16,299
Rewrite this code so
it's more semantic in nature, and

6
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:20,371
if you get it correct,
you'll find a secret word up at the top.

7
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:23,374
Once you've corrected the element
to discover the secret word,

8
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:24,310
put that word here.
