First, we'll identify unlabled
contents by using the screen reader.

[SOUND]
>> Checkbox checked.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,160
>> The promotional offers
Checkbox isn't labeled.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,080
There are two ways to associate
a label with the form element.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,380
Either these methods will cause the
label text to become a click target for

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,770
the check box, which is also super
helpful for pointer based users.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,420
We could wrap the input element in
a label element, or we could use the for

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,575
attribute of the label to associate
it with the ID of the input.

00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:35,978
[NOISE]
>> Receive promotional offers checkbox

10
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:37,090
checked.

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,300
>> Once the checkbox has been
labeled correctly we can see that it

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,120
has a roll of checkbox,
its state is checked and

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,830
it has a label of receive
promotional offers.
