1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,990
All images should have an alt attribute.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,939
Important images should
have descriptive alt text

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,189
that just describes what the image is.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,880
Decorative images like here
should have blank alt text.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,420
The screen reader will skip
that element completely.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,990
You want to include blank text because
if you don't the screen reader may try

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,670
to read the filename and if the file
names weird, it'll sound weird.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,860
So let's go through each of these.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,150
The site logo, just gets and
all text of the site name.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,640
The fact that it's an image makes
the fact that it's a logo obvious.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,880
And even if it's a link to the homepage,
that information is implicit for

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,120
sighted users.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,330
So there's no need to spell it out for
assistive technology users.

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,040
The shopping cart and the top right
hand corner, is significant so

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,440
it needs a useful alt text.

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,590
But the shopping cart in the Add to
Cart button is purely decoration.

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,880
So that can have an all
text to avoid repetition.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,670
The main image here is significant.

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,769
So we can give that a descriptive alt
text and finally the thumbnail images

20
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,460
on the links to other dishes are also
decorative since the link text

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,900
provides the exact same information
we would have put in the alt text.
