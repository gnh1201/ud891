00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,800
When we don't use a button element the
screen reader has no way of knowing what

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,000
it's landed on.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,240
Plus we'd have to do all the extra work
we talked about in the previous lesson

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,850
to make it usable to
keyboard only users.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,914
Right now I can only use
this button with a mouse.

6
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:18,475
We can easily fix this by using
a regular button element,

7
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:19,955
instead of a div.

8
00:00:19,955 --> 00:00:23,075
This also has the added benefit of
taking care of keyboard interactions

9
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:24,225
for us.

10
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:26,415
Once we've fixed the button
we now have our secret word
