The next quiz is all about
thinking about what we know

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,350
as users about the graphical UI
affordances provided by HTML.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,380
Let's take a look at some of the most
common affordances we see on webpages.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,650
All of the form elements we use

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,040
have some familiar semantics which
give us cues as to how we use them.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,945
In this exercise all you need to do
is match up a screenshot of the UI

00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:26,860
element with the semantic
meaning on the right.
