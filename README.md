# Udacity Web Accessibility

Hi there! This is the course repo for Udacity Web Accessibility. Contained in
this repo are a number of sample exercises to help you improve your
accessibility skills.

## Running the examples

Most of the examples can just have their `index.html` dragged into the browser
in order to run. Some examples may require running a local server, an easy
way to run a local server is with [the Web Server for Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en). If you need to run a local server for an example we'll
be sure to note this requirement in the example's README as well as in the
course instructor notes.

## Found a bug?

Please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/udacity/ud891/issues/new)
if you find anything wrong with the exercises.
